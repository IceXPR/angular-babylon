# Angular Babylon Boilerplate (WIP)

This is an Angular Babylon project to practice 3d projects.  It includes an Express server to serve the Angular webapp.

I am still working on the boiler plate, but cant wait to see what projects will be using it.

## Usage

### Start the server
The code below will build the webapp and start the server.
```bash
cd server
npm start
```

## Development

### Develop webapp
```bash
cd webapp
npm start
```

### Develop server

Recommend to build the webapp first
```bash
cd webapp
npm run build
cd ..
```
Then run the server
```bash
cd server
npm run just-server
```
